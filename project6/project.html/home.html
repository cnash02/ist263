        Welcome to my recipe website. This website serves to commemorate and share recipes and stories 
        from my time in the kitchen as a child and young adult. 
        For most of my life the kitchen was a popular gathering place in my home. For weeknight dinners 
        and special events people crowded into our tiny 1920â€™s kitchen to eat, drink, and celebrate. As I 
        grew up, I began to help my parents with the actual food preparation that was happening in that 
        tiny room. Being Italian pasta, artichokes, meatballs and Christmas cookies were all things I started
        to learn how to make. As I got older, I learned to appreciate the way my mother and grandmother 
        prepared my favorite meals. More importantly I realized one day I would have to learn to make 
        them for myself, and my children.

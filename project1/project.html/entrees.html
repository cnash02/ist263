    <h1>Entrees</h1>
    <h2>Myself and my three sisters were definitely not the easiest customers for my mom and dad to feed. 
        If there was something we did not like, they heard about it! Once we all got into sports, clubs, and 
        extracurriculars dinner became a challenge of what could be made that everyone would eat and 
        wouldn’t take time away from our other evening activities. That being said there were also special 
        times like weekends and birthdays where preparing dinner was made an all-day event. There are a 
        few dinners specifically that I remember and to this day these meals still bring me comfort and joy.</h2>

        <h2>This is a staple in our house. When we would come home from school, and mom was making this, 
            we all knew it was going to be a good night. My sisters and I still get excited when we are home 
            and this is on the menu. When I got to college, I knew it was something I needed to learn how to 
            recreate for myself.</h2>

        Homemade Pasta
    </h2>

    <h2>
        As I am sure you are starting to realize there is a common theme to my favorite recipes, most (all) 
of them include some type of pasta or bread. There is nothing like the taste of fresh pasta, maybe it 
is the work you put in. Our first pasta maker was a gift from my grandmother to mother. After that 
broke (don’t get your pasta maker wet!) we purchased a new one to avoid hand rolling our dough.

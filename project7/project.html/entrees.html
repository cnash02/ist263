        If there was something we did not like, they heard about it! Once we all got into sports, clubs, and 
        extracurriculars dinner became a challenge of what could be made that everyone would eat and 
        wouldn’t take time away from our other evening activities. That being said there were also special 
        times like weekends and birthdays where preparing dinner was made an all-day event. There are a 
        few dinners specifically that I remember and to this day these meals still bring me comfort and joy.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by boiling salted water and adding in your pasta of choice and preheating your oven to 350 
            degrees Fahrenheit </li>
            <li>Cook pasta according to box instructions minus 1-2 minutes, pasta should be slightly al dente 
             (firm) because it will continue cooking later </li>
             <li> After draining pasta add the butter and diced onion, salt, pepper and garlic to the now empty pasta
          pot over low to medium heat until the onion is translucent</li>
          <li>Now add a heaping spoonful of flour to make a rue, it should create a paste like substance</li>
            <li> Add your milk to the rue and stir</li>
                <li>Now add the diced cheese to the pot and stir until mostly melted</li>
                    <li>Add pasta to the pot and stir until the noodles are coated in the cheese mixture</li>
                        <li> Pour mixture into your casserole plan, cover with foil, and place in a preheated oven</li>
                            <li>Once you can see bubbles in your mixture remove the foil and allow the top to brown slightly </li>
                                <li>Remove from oven, let set, and serve with a vegetable of your choice</li>

                    As I am sure you are starting to realize there is a common theme to my favorite recipes, most (all) 
            of them include some type of pasta or bread. There is nothing like the taste of fresh pasta, maybe it 
            is the work you put in. Our first pasta maker was a gift from my grandmother to mother. After that 
            broke (don’t get your pasta maker wet!) we purchased a new one to avoid hand rolling our dough.
